"""
This file tests the case that PTB was installed *without* the optional dependency `passport`.
Currently this only means that cryptography is not installed.

Because imports in pytest are intricate, we just run
    pytest -k test_no_passport.py

with the TEST_WITH_OPT_DEPS environment variable set to False in addition to the regular test suite
